Cloud Governance Policy Scanner API
FastAPI application for multi-cloud compliance scanning with OPA integration

This module provides the main FastAPI application for the FinTech Cloud Suite's
Cloud Governance & Compliance Platform. It implements:

1. Multi-cloud resource scanning (AWS, Azure, GCP)
2. OPA (Open Policy Agent) policy evaluation
3. Compliance reporting with detailed violation analysis
4. Background scanning capabilities with progress tracking
5. RESTful API for policy management and evaluation

Architecture:
- FastAPI for async REST API with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Background tasks for long-running compliance scans
- Integration with cloud provider APIs for resource discovery
- OPA integration for policy evaluation using Rego policies
- Structured logging for audit trails and debugging

Usage:
    # Start the application
    python -m src.main
    
    # Or via Docker
    docker-compose up policy-scanner

Environment Variables:
    OPA_URL: URL of the OPA server (default: http://localhost:8181)
    AWS_REGION: AWS region for resource scanning (default: us-east-1)
    AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: Azure subscription ID for resource scanning
    GCP_PROJECT_ID: GCP project ID for resource scanning
    LOG_LEVEL: Logging level (default: INFO)
    PORT: Server port (default: 8080)

        4. Aggregate results with detailed violation information

    Background task for executing comprehensive compliance scans
    
    This asynchronous function performs the actual compliance scanning work
    initiated by the /scan endpoint. It discovers resources across cloud
    providers, applies OPA policies, and updates scan status in real-time.
    
    Args:
        scan_id (str): Unique identifier for tracking scan progress
        scan_request (ScanRequest): Configuration parameters:
            - cloud_providers: List of providers to scan (aws, azure, gcp)
            - resource_types: Specific resource types to evaluate
            - policies: OPA policies to apply during evaluation
            - compliance_frameworks: Target frameworks for reporting
    
    Process Flow:
        1. Resource Discovery Phase:
           - Authenticate with each specified cloud provider
           - Discover all resources matching type filters
           - Aggregate resources across providers
           
        2. Policy Evaluation Phase:
           - Load applicable OPA policies from server
           - Evaluate each resource against policy rules
           - Collect detailed violation information
           
        3. Results Aggregation Phase:
           - Calculate compliance metrics and statistics
           - Update scan status with final results
           - Store detailed evaluation data for retrieval
    
    Error Handling:
        - Cloud provider authentication failures are logged but don't fail scan
        - Individual resource evaluation errors are captured and reported
        - Partial results preserved even if some providers fail
        - Scan status updated to "failed" only on complete failure
    
    Performance Optimizations:
        - Concurrent resource discovery across providers
        - Batch policy evaluation for efficiency
        - Progress updates during long-running operations
        - Memory-efficient resource streaming for large environments
    
    State Management:
        - Real-time updates to scan_results[scan_id] for progress tracking
        - Detailed results stored separately for memory efficiency
        - Thread-safe updates for concurrent access patterns
        - Cleanup of completed scan data after 24 hours
    
    Monitoring and Logging:
        - Structured logging for observability
        - Performance metrics captured for optimization
        - Error details preserved for debugging
        - Resource counts logged for capacity planning
